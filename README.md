**Multilevel Queue (MLQ)** and **Multilevel Feedback Queue (MLFQ)** CPU scheduling algorithms.

**Note:** 
You must modify the archive prueba.txt to enter a set of processes, the program only can calculate one set of processes at time.

**FOR MLF**

Entries should be in the following format:

ID0	BURN TIME0	ARRIVAL TIME0	# COLA0

ID1	BURN TIME1	ARRIVAL TIME1	# COLA1

ID2	BURN TIME2	ARRIVAL TIME2	# COLA2

………………………………………………………………………….

IDn	BURN TIMEn	ARRIVAL TIMEn	No COLAn

Example:

0 6 0 1

5 3 0 1

9 5 0 2

7 2 0 2


**FOR MLFQ**

Entries should be in the following format:

ID0	BURN TIME0	ARRIVAL TIME0

ID1	BURN TIME1	ARRIVAL TIME1

ID2	BURN TIME2	ARRIVAL TIME2 

………………………………………………………

IDn	BURN TIMEn	ARRIVAL TIMEn 



Example:

0 6 0

5 3 0

9 5 0

7 2 0

For this scheduling was assumed Round Robin for every queue but the last one which is calculated with First come, first served.

**POR FAVOR!:** Give the program data consistent with the example proposed in the prueba.txt file, for example the number of queues.**
